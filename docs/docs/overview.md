# Overview

This repository provides a clean and reproducible implementation
of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for solving singular
matrix differential systems.

The focus is on three representative problem classes:

1. Singularly perturbed differential systems with boundary layers
2. Pantograph-type delay differential equations
3. Matrix Riccati differential equations arising in control theory

All implementations are written with clarity and reproducibility
as the primary goals. The numerical experiments are designed to
highlight accuracy, stability, and structure preservation.

The codes are intended for academic and research use.
