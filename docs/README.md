# Documentation

This directory contains supplementary documentation for the MATLAB PINN framework implemented in this repository.

---

## Contents

- `OVERVIEW.md`  
  High-level description of the physics-informed neural network framework, its motivation, and methodological foundations.

Additional documents may be added in the future to describe:
- Mathematical formulations
- Algorithmic details
- Reproducibility notes
- Extended numerical experiments

---

## Scope

The documentation is intentionally concise and focused on explaining:
- Why PINNs are used
- What classes of problems are addressed
- How the framework is structured conceptually

Detailed implementation details are provided directly within the MATLAB source files.

---

## Usage

Readers are encouraged to begin with `OVERVIEW.md` and then explore the MATLAB scripts in the `matlab/` directory for concrete implementations.

---

## Notes

The documentation is written for researchers with a background in:
- Differential equations  
- Numerical analysis  
- Control systems or applied mathematics  

No prior experience with neural networks is assumed beyond basic familiarity.
