## Results Directory

This directory contains numerical outputs generated by the MATLAB-based
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) experiments.

The contents may include:
- Saved solution trajectories
- Error metrics (MAE, maximum error, training loss values)
- Intermediate convergence and refinement data

All numerical values reported in the accompanying manuscript were obtained
by executing the scripts provided in the `matlab/` directory.

To reproduce the reported results, run:
