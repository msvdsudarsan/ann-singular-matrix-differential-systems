# Results Directory

This directory contains numerical outputs generated by the MATLAB-based
Physics-Informed Neural Network (PINN) experiments.

## Contents

The results may include:

- Saved solution trajectories  
- Error metrics (MAE, maximum error, training loss values)  
- Intermediate convergence and refinement data  

All numerical values reported in the accompanying manuscript were obtained
by executing the MATLAB scripts provided in the `matlab/` directory.

## Reproducibility

To reproduce all reported results, run the following command in MATLAB or
MATLAB Online:

```matlab
run_all_experiments
