This folder contains numerical results generated using
Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs) for singular
matrix differential systems.

It includes training logs and error metrics for:
1. Singular perturbation problems
2. Pantograph delay differential equations
3. Matrix Riccati differential equations
