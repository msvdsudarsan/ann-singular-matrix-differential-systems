# Numerical Results

This folder contains the output generated from the MATLAB
implementations of Physics-Informed Neural Networks (PINNs).

The experiments focus on solution accuracy, stability,
and qualitative behavior rather than benchmark competition.

## Contents

- Training loss histories printed during execution
- Error metrics such as mean absolute error (MAE)
- Visual inspection of solution behavior (when plots are enabled)

---

## Interpretation

The results demonstrate that PINN-based solvers can successfully
approximate solutions of singular matrix differential systems,
including problems with boundary layers, delays, and matrix-valued states.

While training requires an initial computational cost, the learned
models provide smooth and stable approximations across the domain.
